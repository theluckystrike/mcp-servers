    title: "How to track billable hours inside Claude Code and Cursor",
    description: "Start a timer, log forgotten hours, get a weekly report and invoice lines without leaving the chat. Setup, tools and measured call counts.",
    html: `<h1>How to track billable hours inside Claude Code and Cursor</h1>
<p>If you bill by the hour and you already spend the day inside Claude Code or Cursor, the timesheet is
the part that gets lost. You finish a task, move to the next one, and at the end of the week you
reconstruct Tuesday from git history. The MCP Time Tracker puts the timer where the work happens: you
say "start a timer for Acme, task API refactor", keep working, and later ask for the week's hours.
Entries are plain JSON under your home directory. Nothing is uploaded.</p>

<h2>Install it</h2>
<p>One command for Claude Code:</p>
<pre><code>claude mcp add time-tracker -- npx -y @theluckystrike/mcp-time-tracker</code></pre>
<p>Cursor reads the same kind of config. Add this to <code>~/.cursor/mcp.json</code> (or the project-level
<code>.cursor/mcp.json</code>), then restart Cursor:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "time-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theluckystrike/mcp-time-tracker"]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Claude Desktop uses <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> with exactly the same block. There is no
account, no API key and no login step: the server runs locally over stdio and writes to
<code>~/.local/share/mcp-servers/time-tracker/</code>.</p>

<h2>The four things you actually do</h2>
<p><strong>Start and stop a timer.</strong> Say "start tracking time on the Acme website project". Only one
timer runs at a time, so starting a second one stops and logs the first. "Stop the timer and tell me how
long I worked" closes it and writes the entry.</p>
<p><strong>Log time you forgot.</strong> The timer is not the only path in. "Log 2.5 hours yesterday for Acme,
design review, at 90 euros an hour" writes a complete entry: project, task, duration, rate and currency.
The rate accepts the words you said, so "90 euros an hour" stores 90 EUR rather than defaulting to
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Get a report.</strong> "How many hours did I put into Acme this week, grouped by task" returns totals
in hours and money. Grouping works by project, day, task or tag.</p>
<p><strong>Turn it into invoice lines.</strong> "Give me invoice lines for Acme in August" returns one line per
task with hours, rate and amount, plus a total. Those lines feed straight into
<a href="/guides/invoice-pdf-from-chat">an invoice PDF</a> if you also run the invoice server.</p>

<h2>What the audit measured</h2>
<p>The servers were driven by the real Claude CLI as an MCP client against a fresh data directory, with
prompts phrased the way a person phrases them and no tool names mentioned. Starting the timer, stopping
it, and logging a forgotten 2.5 hour entry each completed in a single tool call: one call, one correct
result, no clarifying question. The weekly billing question took three calls, because the model asked for
a report and then invoice lines separately. Round trip times were 8.6 s, 9.4 s and 10.0 s for the
single-call steps.</p>
<p>The same audit found two real defects and both are fixed in the shipped server. The currency in
"90 euros an hour" used to be dropped, so a report printed dollars for euro work; <code>entry_add</code>
now takes a currency, in words or as an ISO code. Project names that differed only in phrasing
("the Acme website project" and "for Acme") used to create two projects and split the week's billing;
a partial name that matches exactly one existing project now resolves to that project.</p>

<h2>Money arithmetic</h2>
<p>Hours are stored as seconds and money as integer minor units. An entry's amount is computed from
seconds and the rate in one rounding step, then summed, so the total of a report equals the sum of the
lines you can see. There is no floating point drift between what the report shows and what you invoice.</p>

<h2>Free tier and Pro</h2>
<p>Free gives unlimited timers and entries, reports and CSV export over the last 7 days, and two projects
with an hourly rate. Pro ($19 once, lifetime) opens full history, invoice summaries, grouping by tag and
unlimited rated projects. The full comparison is in
<a href="/guides/mcp-server-free-vs-pro">free versus Pro</a>. Product page:

    title: "Create an invoice PDF from a chat message with an MCP server",
    description: "Say the invoice in one sentence and get a numbered A4 PDF with VAT lines. Worked example: 12 h at 90 EUR plus 300 setup, 23% VAT, 1697.40.",
    html: `<h1>Create an invoice PDF from a chat message with an MCP server</h1>
<p>Most invoicing tools want you to leave what you are doing, open a web app, fill a form and download a
file. If you already have Claude or Cursor open, the whole thing is one sentence: "invoice Acme for 12
hours of API work at 90 EUR plus a 300 EUR setup fee, 23% VAT, due in 14 days, and give me the PDF."
The MCP Invoice server allocates the number, computes the tax lines and renders an A4 PDF on your disk.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code>claude mcp add invoice -- npx -y @theluckystrike/mcp-invoice</code></pre>
<p>For Cursor or Claude Desktop, the same server as a config block:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "invoice": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theluckystrike/mcp-invoice"]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2>Set your business once</h2>
<p>The issuer block printed at the top of every invoice comes from one call. Say it in free text: your
business name, address, VAT id, IBAN, default currency EUR, default tax rate 23%, payment terms 14 days.
In the audit, every one of those fields was parsed out of a single sentence in a single tool call. After
that you never repeat it.</p>

<h2>Numbering that cannot repeat</h2>
<p>Invoice numbers are allocated in the form <code>INV-YYYY-NNNN</code> and a number is never reused, even
if you delete the invoice afterwards. That matters for the same reason it matters in any accounting
system: a tax authority reading a gap in the sequence wants an explanation. The prefix defaults to
<code>INV</code>; a custom prefix is a Pro feature. Allocation happens under a file lock, so two invoices
created in the same second do not collide.</p>

<h2>The worked example</h2>
<p>Take the request above. Two lines, one tax rate:</p>
<pre><code>invoice_create
  client: "Acme"
  currency: "EUR"
  due_days: 14
  items:
    - description: "API work",   quantity: 12, unit_price: 90,  tax_rate: 23
    - description: "Setup fee",  quantity: 1,  unit_price: 300, tax_rate: 23</code></pre>
<p>The arithmetic: 12 x 90 = 1080.00, plus 300.00, subtotal 1380.00. VAT at 23% on 1380.00 is 317.40.
Total 1697.40 EUR. That is the exact figure the audit produced from the natural language prompt, in two
tool calls including the PDF render. Amounts are held as integer minor units and each line is rounded
before the lines are summed, so the printed total always equals the printed lines added up. Several VAT
rates on one invoice produce one tax line per rate, and a discount percent is applied to every line
before tax.</p>

<h2>The PDF</h2>
<p><code>invoice_pdf</code> renders A4 with pdfkit and returns the file path. The layout is a business name
on the left, INVOICE and the number on the right, an issue/due/status block, a BILL TO block, a
four column line table carrying per-line tax, right aligned subtotal, discount, tax lines and total, then
payment details with IBAN and reference. Long descriptions wrap and long tables page. Nothing about the
render touches the network, so the invoice for a client under NDA never leaves the machine.</p>
<p>One thing worth doing before you send: add the client's postal address. If you create an invoice for a
name the server has never seen, it adds the client silently with nothing but that name, and BILL TO on
the PDF is a bare word. Store the client once with <code>client_add</code> and every later invoice is
complete.</p>

<h2>Getting paid and chasing</h2>
<p><code>invoice_mark_paid</code> records a payment; a smaller amount than the total marks the invoice
partial and reports the balance. <code>overdue_report</code> lists everything unpaid past its due date
with days overdue and outstanding totals per currency. If you also track time, see
<a href="/guides/track-time-in-claude-code">tracking billable hours</a>: the invoice lines the time
tracker produces are the items this server wants.</p>

<h2>Free tier</h2>
<p>Free covers 3 invoices per calendar month, with a small footer line on the PDF; the overdue report is
free. Pro ($19 once) removes the count limit and the footer, and adds a logo and a custom number prefix.

    faq: [
      { q: "Can I put several VAT rates on one invoice?", a: "Yes. Tax rate is per line item. The totals block prints one tax line per distinct rate, so a 23% line and a 0% reverse-charge line appear separately and the total adds up." },
      { q: "Is the PDF good enough to send to a client's accounts department?", a: "It is a single page A4 with issuer and client blocks, dates, a line table with per-line tax, subtotal, tax lines, total, and payment details with IBAN and reference. Add the client's address with client_add first, otherwise BILL TO shows only the name." },
      { q: "What is the invoice number format and can I change it?", a: "INV-YYYY-NNNN, allocated in sequence and never reused. The prefix is configurable with business_set; a prefix other than INV is a Pro feature." },

    title: "Ask questions about an Excel or CSV file from Cursor or Claude",
    description: "Open xlsx and csv from the chat: describe the sheet, filter and group without code, add a computed column, convert. Handles messy header rows.",
    html: `<h1>Ask questions about an Excel or CSV file from Cursor or Claude</h1>
<p>The usual way an assistant reads a spreadsheet is to write a throwaway pandas script, run it, and read
the output. That works until the file has a title row above the headers, or prices stored as text, or
40,000 rows you do not want printed into the context window. The MCP Spreadsheet server gives the model
four purpose-built tools instead: describe the file, query it, add a computed column, convert it. It
opens xlsx, xlsm, xlsb, ods, csv and tsv.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code>claude mcp add spreadsheet -- npx -y @theluckystrike/mcp-spreadsheet</code></pre>
<p>Cursor, in <code>~/.cursor/mcp.json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "spreadsheet": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theluckystrike/mcp-spreadsheet"]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2>Start with sheet_info</h2>
<p>"Open sales.xlsx and tell me what is in it" runs <code>sheet_info</code>: sheet names, row and column
counts, the guessed header row, a type per column, sample values and empty counts. This is the step that
handles the export nobody designed for a machine. In the audit the test file carried a title line and a
blank line above the real headers; <code>sheet_info</code> reported <code>headerRow=2</code>, three
sheets and 400 rows, with correct types and ranges. Delimiters in csv files are sniffed rather than
assumed, so a semicolon-separated European export opens without an argument.</p>

<h2>Query with a filter and a group by</h2>
<p>"Which rep sold the most units in the North region? Top 5 with totals" is one call:</p>
<pre><code>sheet_query
  path: "/Users/you/sales.xlsx"
  sheet: "Sales"
  where: '[Region] = "North"'
  group_by: ["Rep"]
  aggregate: [{"col": "Units", "fn": "sum", "as": "total_units"}]
  sort: {"col": "total_units", "dir": "desc"}
  limit: 5</code></pre>
<p>The <code>where</code> string is a small safe expression language, not eval: comparisons
= != &gt; &gt;= &lt; &lt;=, plus contains, startswith and endswith, combined with AND, OR, NOT and
parentheses. Column names with spaces go in brackets. Aggregate functions are sum, count, avg, min and
max, and <code>sort</code> can name an aggregate alias. Numbers written as text, such as
<code>"$1,250.00"</code>, are read as numbers. Grouping was added after the audit measured the same
ranking taking five tool calls and 71 seconds, because the model had to fall back to python; it is now
one call.</p>

<h2>Add a column, convert the file</h2>
<p>"Add a Revenue column that is Units times Unit Price and save it as CSV next to the original" runs
<code>sheet_add_column</code> with the formula <code>[Units] * [Unit Price]</code>. The source file is
never overwritten unless you pass an output path that points at it. <code>sheet_convert</code> moves
between csv, xlsx and json the same way. <code>sheet_stats</code> gives count, empties, distinct, min,
max, sum, mean and median per column, and <code>sheet_find</code> searches every cell and returns cell
addresses with a preview of the row.</p>

<h2>The free write cap refuses rather than truncating</h2>
<p>The audit caught a bad failure here and it was fixed. Adding a column to a 400 row sheet on the free
tier used to write 200 rows and report success, leaving a file that looked complete and was not. The
write cap now refuses: nothing is written, the tool tells you the row count and the cap, and it suggests
a way through on the free tier, such as filtering with <code>sheet_query</code> first and writing only
the rows you need. A partial file that looks whole is worse than no file.</p>

<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Free reads files up to 5 MB and 5,000 rows, with every tool available, and writes up to 500 rows per
file. Over a read limit the tool still returns the first 5,000 rows with a note saying what was left out.
Pro ($19 once) removes both, up to a 50 MB file ceiling. See
<a href="/s/spreadsheet">MCP Spreadsheet</a> and

    title: "Watch a product price with Claude and get told when it drops",
    description: "Check a shop price from the chat, keep a watch with history and a target, refresh on demand. Honest about bot walls and the missing background job.",
    html: `<h1>Watch a product price with Claude and get told when it drops</h1>
<p>You can ask an assistant to fetch a product page and read the price off it, and it will usually get
something. The MCP Price Tracker exists because "usually get something" is a bad basis for a price
watch: you need a normalised decimal price, the currency, a check that you are still on the product page,
and a history to compare against. This guide covers what the server does well and, more usefully, the
two places where it will disappoint you.</p>

<h2>Install</h2>
<pre><code>claude mcp add price-tracker -- npx -y @theluckystrike/mcp-price-tracker</code></pre>
<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "price-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theluckystrike/mcp-price-tracker"]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>

<h2>price_check: what does this cost right now</h2>
<p>Paste a product URL and ask what it costs. <code>price_check</code> fetches the page and extracts the
price from JSON-LD, microdata, Open Graph tags, common price markup or a currency-aware text fallback,
in that order of preference. It normalises 1.299,00 EUR and 1,299.00 USD to the same number, returns the
product title and the currency, and reports the change against the last price stored for that URL. Every
reading carries a confidence level: high for JSON-LD, microdata and Open Graph, medium for data
attributes and class hints, low for the regex fallback.</p>

<h2>Read this before you rely on it: five of twelve retailers block bots</h2>
<p>Twelve real retail URLs were tested against the compiled fetcher, with the extracted price checked
against the HTML by hand. Five returned HTTP 403 from a bot wall: H&amp;M, Allegro, MediaMarkt, Home
Depot and Etsy. One timed out after 15 seconds (Best Buy). One followed a redirect off the product page
onto a category listing and returned the cheapest item there, which is the worst possible failure for a
price watcher. That leaves 5 of 12 correct, or 41.7%.</p>
<p>Of the 7 pages that did return HTML, 6 yielded a price and 5 of those were right, so the extractor is
not the constraint; reach is. Apple, Walmart, Newegg and Gap parsed correctly. The redirect case was
fixed afterwards: the server now refuses a reading when the final URL lands on a home page, enters a
category or search segment the request was not in, or the title is generic such as "Products". You get an
error naming the redirect instead of a number that was never the price. For shops behind a bot wall the
403 message names the cause and points you at <code>price_add_manual</code>, which stores a price you
read yourself and creates the watch.</p>

<h2>watch, refresh, and the absence of a background job</h2>
<p>"Watch this page and tell me if it drops under 900" creates a watch with a target. What it does not do
is poll. There is no scheduler, no daemon and no notification path: nothing runs when your chat is
closed. Checks happen when you ask for them. The pattern that works is to say "refresh my watches" at
the start of a session; <code>watch_refresh</code> re-fetches one watch or all of them, appends the new
observations and reports current, previous, min, max, change percent and target hits.
<code>alerts_pending</code> then lists everything that hit its target or fell 5% or more since the last
check, and it is free rather than gated, because a price watcher that cannot tell you what dropped is not
a price watcher.</p>
<p>If you want an unattended check, wire <code>watch_refresh</code> to your own cron or launchd job that
starts the client. That is outside the server on purpose: a local MCP server has no business running a
background process on your machine.</p>

<h2>One more thing that will happen</h2>
<p>With a general web fetch tool available, the model may answer "what does this cost" by fetching the
page itself and never calling the server. That was measured. The tool descriptions now state what the
server adds over a raw fetch, which fixes it most of the time; if you want certainty, name the tool:
"use price_check on this URL".</p>

<h2>Free tier</h2>
<p>Free gives unlimited price checks with confidence, 3 watches with 30 observations each, and pending
alerts. Pro ($19 once) gives unlimited watches, full history and refresh-all.

<h2>What a limit does when you hit it</h2>
<p>No limit corrupts data or fails silently. Over a spreadsheet read cap, the tool returns the rows it is
allowed to return and appends a note saying how many were left out. Over a write cap, nothing at all is
written: an earlier version wrote 200 of 400 rows and reported success, which produced a file that looked
complete, and that behaviour was removed. Over the time tracker's 7 day window, nothing is deleted;
older entries stay on disk and appear the moment a key is activated. Gated tools return one plain message
naming the feature, the price and the checkout URL.</p>

<h2>How the key works</h2>
<p>After payment you get a key that looks like <code>MCPL1.xxx.yyy</code>. It is an Ed25519 signature over
a small payload: the product, an id, and the issue time. Verification happens locally against a public
key compiled into the server. Two consequences worth stating plainly. The servers never phone home,
because there is nothing to phone home about: no activation server, no license check on startup, no
telemetry, no usage counting. And activation works with the network off, on a plane or on an air-gapped
machine.</p>
<p>Activate it either way:</p>
<pre><code># In the chat, run the license_activate tool with your key, or:
export MCP_LICENSE_KEY=MCPL1.xxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyy

# Or write it once for every server on this machine:
mkdir -p ~/.config/mcp-servers
printf '{"key":"MCPL1.xxxxxxxx.yyyyyyyy"}' > ~/.config/mcp-servers/license.json</code></pre>
<p>Lookup order is the environment variable, then that config file, then the free tier. The bundle key
carries a wildcard product, so one key covers all four servers with the same steps. Every tool ships in
the free build; a Pro key removes limits rather than downloading anything.</p>

<h2>Buying, and getting your money back</h2>
<p>Checkout is Stripe. The key appears on the success page immediately after payment and no email is sent
with it, so save it there. If you lose it, the same page can be reloaded, and support@zovo.one can
recover it from the session id printed on your Stripe receipt. Refunds within 14 days, no argument and no
form: mail support@zovo.one. Prices are one-time; there is no renewal to cancel and no card on file to
remove.</p>

<h2>Which one to buy</h2>
<p>If one server is a daily tool for you, buy that server. If two or more are, the bundle is cheaper than
two. The honest guidance: try the free tier for a week first, and buy when a limit gets in your way,
because for a light user the free tier is the whole product. See the guides for

    html: `<h1>Log expenses and mileage in Claude, split VAT, rebill to an invoice</h1>
<p>The usual way to keep a business expense ledger is a spreadsheet you update days later from a pile of
receipts, or an app you open, log into and tap through. The MCP Expense Tracker puts the ledger in the
chat window: say "61.50 euros at Adobe, software, 23% VAT, billable to Acme" and it is logged with the
VAT already split out, categorised from a rule you set once, and marked ready to rebill. Everything is a
plain JSON file on your own machine.</p>

<h2>Install it</h2>
<p>One command for Claude Code:</p>
<pre><code>claude mcp add expense-tracker -- npx -y @theluckystrike/mcp-expense-tracker</code></pre>
<p>Cursor reads the same kind of config. Add this to <code>~/.cursor/mcp.json</code> (or the project-level
<code>.cursor/mcp.json</code>), then restart Cursor:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "mcpServers": {
    "expense-tracker": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@theluckystrike/mcp-expense-tracker"]
    }
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>Claude Desktop uses <code>claude_desktop_config.json</code> with the same block. There is no account, no
API key and no login step: the server runs locally over stdio and writes to
<code>~/.local/share/mcp-servers/expense-tracker/</code>.</p>

<h2>Log a receipt and watch the VAT split</h2>
<p>Every amount you say is the gross figure printed on the receipt. <code>vat_rate</code> does the rest:
<code>net = round(gross * 100 / (100 + rate))</code> and <code>vat = gross - net</code>, so net plus VAT
is always exactly the gross, to the cent. Take the line above: 61.50 EUR gross at 23% VAT splits to
net 50.00 EUR and VAT 11.50 EUR. Money is stored as integer minor units in the expense's own currency, so
that split has no floating point residue and a summary of many expenses adds up to the same total you
would get by hand.</p>
<p>An empty category is not left blank. If you have told the server that Adobe means software, the same
sentence without a category still files it under software, because <code>expense_add</code> checks the
stored merchant rules before it gives up and leaves the field empty.</p>

<h2>Categories that learn from you, not from a fixed list</h2>
<p><code>category_rules</code> holds a list of match-to-category pairs. Each match is tried first as a
case-insensitive regular expression and, if that is not valid regex, as a plain substring, so "adobe" or
"amazon.*office" both work without escaping. The first rule that matches wins. Call
<code>category_rules</code> with no arguments to see what is stored, or replace the whole list at once:
no machine learning, no confidence score, just the rule you wrote read back to you exactly.</p>

<h2>Mileage from a rate table, not a guess</h2>
<p>"Log a 45 km trip in Poland for a client meeting in Krakow, billable to Acme" prices itself:
<code>mileage_add</code> multiplies distance by the region's rate and rounds once. The built-in table is
PL 1.15 PLN per km, UK 0.45 GBP per mile, US 0.70 USD per mile and EU 0.30 EUR per km. 45 km at the Polish
rate is 45 x 1.15 = 51.75 PLN, stored as an expense in PLN with no VAT rate, because mileage allowances are
not usually VAT-bearing. With no region given, kilometres default to the EU rate and miles to the US rate;
<code>rate_per_km</code> overrides the table entirely if your own employer or tax authority sets a
different figure. These are convenience defaults, not tax advice: check the rate your own authority allows
for the year before you rely on it.</p>

<h2>Receipts you can prove later</h2>
<p><code>receipt_attach</code> takes a path to the receipt file, checks that it exists, and stores the path
together with a sha256 of its bytes. That hash is the part worth having: if the file on disk is ever
edited or replaced, the stored hash no longer matches it, so an audit later has a way to prove the receipt
attached to an expense is the same file that was there when the expense was logged.</p>

<h2>Summaries, always per currency</h2>
<p>"How much did I spend on software this quarter, and what is still billable to Acme" runs
<code>expense_summary</code> grouped by category, project, month or merchant, reporting the gross, the net
and the VAT for each group. Currencies are never mixed: an expense in PLN and one in EUR appear as two
lines under the same category rather than one wrong total. <code>expense_list</code> answers narrower
questions the same way, with totals per currency for whatever date range and filters you gave it.</p>

<h2>Rebilling without taxing twice</h2>
<p>The point of marking an expense billable is to get it onto a client's invoice, and the wiring to
<a href="/guides/invoice-pdf-from-chat">the invoice server</a> is the part worth being precise about.
<code>expense_to_invoice</code> takes a project and a date range and returns line items shaped exactly as
<code>invoice_create</code> expects: <code>{description, quantity, unit_price, tax_rate}</code>. The
<code>unit_price</code> it sends is the <strong>net</strong> amount, not the gross, and <code>tax_rate</code>
carries the VAT rate along with it. The invoice server then computes its own tax line from
<code>unit_price</code> and <code>tax_rate</code>, which lands on the same 11.50 EUR of VAT the expense
already split out. If the rebill sent the gross 61.50 EUR as the unit price instead, the invoice would add
23% VAT on top of an amount that already included VAT once, over-charging the client by the whole VAT
figure. Because one invoice carries one currency, expenses in more than one currency come back grouped by
currency, and you pass one group per invoice. Expenses are marked rebilled once sent, so asking again for
the same project and range does not bill the client twice; <code>include_rebilled</code> and
<code>mark_rebilled</code> exist for the times you want to override that.</p>

<h2>Export and free tier</h2>
<p><code>expense_export</code> writes a date range to csv, xlsx or json and never writes a partial file: if
a limit would be exceeded, nothing is created at all and the tool says why. Free covers unlimited logging
of expenses, mileage and receipts, a 30-day window on <code>expense_list</code> and
<code>expense_summary</code>, 3 projects, 5 category rules, csv and json export up to 200 rows, and
<code>expense_to_invoice</code> for up to 20 items at cost price. Pro ($19 once) opens full history,
unlimited projects and rules, xlsx export, and a <code>markup_percent</code> on the rebill. Full comparison

      { q: "How exactly is VAT split out of a receipt amount?", a: "The amount you give is the gross figure on the receipt. net = round(gross * 100 / (100 + vat_rate)) and vat = gross - net, so net plus VAT always equals the gross exactly. 61.50 EUR at 23% VAT splits to net 50.00 EUR and VAT 11.50 EUR." },
      { q: "What are the mileage rates and can I use my own?", a: "The built-in table is PL 1.15 PLN/km, UK 0.45 GBP/mile, US 0.70 USD/mile, EU 0.30 EUR/km, with EU used by default for kilometres and US for miles. rate_per_km overrides the table with your own figure and currency. These are convenience defaults, not tax advice." },
      { q: "Does rebilling an expense charge VAT twice?", a: "No. expense_to_invoice sends the net amount as unit_price and the original rate as tax_rate, so invoice_create computes the same VAT figure once. Sending the gross amount instead would tax an already-taxed figure a second time, which is why the server sends net." },
      { q: "How does it prove a receipt file has not been altered?", a: "receipt_attach stores the file's path together with a sha256 hash of its bytes at the moment you attach it. If the file is later edited or swapped, the stored hash no longer matches it, which is what an audit checks." },
      { q: "Is anything uploaded when I log an expense or export a report?", a: "No. All data is stored in a plain JSON file under ~/.local/share/mcp-servers/expense-tracker/, and the server makes no network calls at all.
