/**
 * The ledger engine, as a stable public API for other servers in this repo.
 *
 * `src/index.ts` is the MCP server (tools, licensing, tool copy). Everything below it --
 * the chart of accounts, the posting rules, the bank matching, the trial balance and the
 * CSV writer -- is generic and is re-exported here so a sibling server can derive a
 * double-entry view of the same books without a second copy of the rules.
 *
 * The money formatting is NOT re-exported: it lives in `@theluckystrike/mcp-invoice/lib`.
 * Neither is the payment reconstruction, which lives in
 * `@theluckystrike/mcp-statement-of-account/lib`, nor any writer for the six stores this
 * server reads: it reads those and never writes them.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the network or the licence store at import time.
 *
 * Stability: the names below are the contract. `@theluckystrike/mcp-cash-book/dist/*.js`
 * deep imports are not.
