/**
 * The depreciation engine, as a stable public API for other servers in this repo.
 *
 * `src/index.ts` is the MCP server (tools, licensing, storage). Everything below it --
 * the bundled rate tables, the schedule arithmetic and the asset store -- is generic and
 * is re-exported here so a sibling server can depreciate an asset without a second copy
 * of the rules, and without a second copy of the tables that would drift from these.
 *
 * Nothing in this module touches the network. The tables are read from disk on first use.
 *
 * Stability: the names below are the contract. `dist/*.js` deep imports are not.
