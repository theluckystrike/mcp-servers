/**
 * The depreciation engine. Three rules live here and nothing else does.
 *
 * 1. Money is integer minor units end to end. Every rate is applied to a float, but the
 *    float never leaves this file: the raw per-period amounts are handed to `allocate`,
 *    which converts them to minor units by CUMULATIVE rounding and makes the last period
 *    absorb the remainder, so the schedule sums to the depreciable base to the cent by
 *    construction rather than by luck. A schedule that is a cent short of the base is a
 *    trial balance that does not balance.
 *
 * 2. The convention is the table's, not the caller's. Poland starts in the month AFTER
 *    the asset enters the register (art. 16h ust. 1 pkt 1), the US GDS tables already
 *    carry the half-year convention inside the published percentages, and a UK writing
 *    down allowance is a full-period allowance on a pool. Every answer names the
 *    convention it used.
 *
 * 3. Nothing is invented. Where a scheme has no statutory concept for something the tool
 *    is asked for -- a useful life for a UK pool, a salvage value under MACRS -- the
 *    answer says the value was derived or ignored, in words, rather than presenting it as
 *    a rate someone published.
